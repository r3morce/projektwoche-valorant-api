# To hold information which belongs together you can use a dictionary
# A dictionary is build like this
this_is_a__dictionary = {
    "key": "value"
}

# You could store a persons data in a dictionary
random_person = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 45
}

# You can print dictionaries too
print("1)", random_person)

# If you are interested in just a specifiy value, you can access this value like this
print("2)", random_person["name"])

# TODO: Fill the dictionary 'you' with your data
you = {


}

# TODO: Print the whole 'you' dictionary


# TODO: From the 'you' dictionary, print only one value


# TODO: From the 'you' dictionary, save one value in a variable and print this variable

# After a dictionary is created, you can add new values like this
you["status"] = "pupil"

# TODO: Add another value to 'you' and print the whole dictionary
