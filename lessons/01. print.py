# In this lesson we write our first script

# This is how to put text on your terminal in a python script
print("Hello World")

# TODO: Run this python script with the play button top right

# The text "Hello World" is a data type called string, because it's a string of characters.

# Comments can be used to explain Python code.
# Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
# Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

# TODO: Uncomment the line below by deleting the hashtag # and write your own name after Hello
# print("Hello ")

# TODO: Run your python script with the play button top right

# All done? Good job, you just wrote your first code.
