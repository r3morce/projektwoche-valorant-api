# In this lesson we write our first script

# This is how to put text on your terminal in a python script
print("Hello World")

# TODO: Run your python script with the play button top right

# Lines which start with # are comments and ignored while executing a script like this

# TODO: Uncomment the line below and write your own name in it
# print("Hello ")

# All done? Good job, you just wrote your first code.
