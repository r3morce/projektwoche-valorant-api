# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on strings.

# "Valorant" is a string
name_of_the_game = "Valorant"

# Strings can be printed, nothing new so far
print("1)", name_of_the_game)

# Strings have a built-in methods called 'lower()'
# lower() returns the same string but lower cased
# Let's use it
print("2)", name_of_the_game.lower())

# You can store the new string in a new variable
name_of_the_game_lower = name_of_the_game.lower()

# And print it
print("3)", name_of_the_game.lower())


# TODO: Print 'name_of_the_game', but with the function upper case


# TODO: Print 'name_of_the_game'


# TODO: Discuss why are the outputs different


# TODO: Create an variable 'name_of_the_game_upper' and save the upper cased version of itself in it


# TODO: Override the variable 'name_of_the_game' with an upper cased version of itself


# TODO: print 'name_of_the_game' again
