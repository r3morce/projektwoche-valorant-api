# In this lesson we lean about variables and printing several things

# You can use variables to save something for later usage
name_of_the_game = "Valorant"
# name_of_the_game is a variable and saves the string "Valorant"

# TODO: Save your name in a variable
your_name = ""

# Variables can be printed too
# TODO: Execute the script
print(your_name)

# TODO: Print the variable 'name_of_the_game'

# You can also print several things in one line
print("1)", "Today we lean about coding and", name_of_the_game)
print("2)", "Today we lean about coding and", name_of_the_game, "and stuff")

# TODO: Print the content of 'your_name' and 'name_of_the_game' in one line.
# Hint: Use the print command from line 16 and modify it
