# TODO: Create and fill a variable 'name_of_the_game'

# You can put placeholder in strings and fill them with function format
# {} is a placeholder and is filled with the variable 'name_of_the_game'
print("1)", "Today we lean about {} and coding".format(name_of_the_game))

# TODO: Save your name again in a variable called 'your_name'


# TODO: Fill the following sentence with your name
# Hint: We did a similar thing above
print("2)", "Hello, isn't the weather beautiful today?".format())

# Bonus: Fill the print command below with two placeholders: {}
